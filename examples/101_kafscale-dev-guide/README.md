# KafScale Quickstart Guide

**Get Your Spring Boot + Kafka Application Running on KafScale in 30 Minutes**

Welcome to the KafScale Quickstart Guide! This tutorial will help you quickly set up KafScale locally using the Makefile flows and connect your existing Spring Boot + Kafka application to it.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you will:

- ✅ Understand what KafScale is and when to use it
- ✅ Run a local KafScale demo with `make demo` (no Docker Compose)
- ✅ Run a full platform demo on kind with `make demo-guide-pf`
- ✅ Configure your Spring Boot application to connect to KafScale
- ✅ Produce and consume messages successfully
- ✅ Troubleshoot common issues

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [ ] **Go** installed (for running the broker in the local demo)
- [ ] **Docker** installed (used only for the MinIO helper container)
- [ ] **kind**, **kubectl**, and **helm** installed (for the platform demo)
- [ ] **Java 11+** and **Maven** or **Gradle**
- [ ] An existing **Spring Boot application** that uses Kafka
- [ ] Basic understanding of Kafka concepts (topics, producers, consumers)
- [ ] **Git** (to clone the KafScale repository)

## Picking a Deployment Mode

Not sure which mode fits? The guide includes a short question list to help you choose:

- **Local app + local broker** (default)
- **In-cluster app + broker** (cluster)
- **Local app + remote broker** (local-lb)

See [Running Your Application](04-running-your-app.md) for the decision checklist.
